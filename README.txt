This project is to explore and learn how to do hyperparameter tuning.
1. Grid Search
2. Randomized Search: generate a few random parameter sets and select a the best one. 
Because the number of randomized search is generally smaller than the grid search, it is usually faster.
3. Bayesian model Optimization using HyperOpt
